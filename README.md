## Overview
Proximeter is a location-based app that allows users to define points as they move around a perimeter using GPS technology. Once a minimum of four points are defined, the app calculates the enclosed area in both meters and feet. Whether you need to measure land, plan outdoor activities, or conduct geographical surveys, Proximeter provides high accuracy and ease of use to get the job done efficiently.

## Features
- Define points on a map by moving around the perimeter using GPS.
- Calculate the enclosed area based on the defined points in both meters and feet.
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy point tracking and area calculation.
- Real-time location tracking for accurate and precise measurements.
- Support for various units of measurement to cater to different needs.
